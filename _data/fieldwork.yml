      Conducted snowpack fieldwork at Col du Lautaret, France as part of WSL‑SLF’s Snow Science Winter School, using tools like SnowMicroPen, DUFISSS, IceCube, and density cutters to measure penetration resistance, density, and specific surface area. 
      Processed and visualized snow and weather data with Crocus models, DEMs, and Python, while collaborating with international researchers during hands-on field exercises and data workshops.
