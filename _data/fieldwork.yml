      Supported paleomagnetic sampling of 15 lava flows in the Langjökull region with the <a href="https://english.hi.is/" target="_blank">University of Iceland (HÍ)</a>, using a portable drill, 
      orienting fixture, and Brunton compass for age-dating analysis. Assisted with field logistics including 4x4 travel on F-roads and river crossings.

    description: >
      Conducted snowpack fieldwork at Col du Lautaret, France as part of <a href="https://www.slf.ch/en/" target="_blank">WSL‑SLF</a>’s Snow Science Winter School, using tools like SnowMicroPen, DUFISSS, IceCube, and density cutters to measure penetration resistance, density, and specific surface area. 
      Processed and visualized snow and weather data with Crocus models, DEMs, and Python, while collaborating with international researchers during hands-on field exercises and data workshops.

    description: >
      Participated in a expedition with <a href="https://juneauicefield.org/" target="_blank">JIRP</a>, gathering glacier mass-balance and seismology data, conducting GPS-based ice-flow velocity surveys on the Vaughan Lewis Icefall, and completing a 75-mile traverse from Juneau, AK to Atlin, BC. 
      Developed technical experience in glacier travel, crevasse rescue, ropework, and backcountry survival.

    description: >
      Supported plant biomass and soils research at the University of Alaska Fairbanks' <a href="https://toolik.alaska.edu/" target="_blank">TFS</a> by identifying over 30 Arctic plant species and sorting tundra quadrats for biomass and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio analysis. 
      Contributed to studies linking vegetation composition to eddy-covariance carbon flux measurements.
