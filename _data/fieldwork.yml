      Student at the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (WSL‑SLF)'s Snow Science Winter School.  
      Conducted snowpack fieldwork at Col du Lautaret,France, performing penetration resistance, density, and specific surface area measurements using SnowMicroPen, DUFISSS, IceCube, and density cutters. Processed and visualized snowpack simulations, atmospheric data, and snow properties using Crocus models, weather‑station data, DEMs, and Python analysis tools. Collaborated with international snow‑science experts through field exercises, workshops, and data‑viz projects.

      on the Juneau, Alaska icefiled, Collected glacier mass‑balance and seismology data, ran a GPS survey on the Vaughan Lewis Icefall for ice‑flow velocimetry, and completed a 75‑mile (120 km) icefield traverse from Juneau, AK to Atlin, BC. Developed mountaineering skills—glacier travel, crevasse rescue, rope‑handling, and remote survival techniques.
