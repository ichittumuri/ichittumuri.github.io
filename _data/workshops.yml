      Attended the NSF-funded <a href="https://glamacles.github.io/" target="_blank">GlaMacLeS</a> held at the Taft-Nicholson Center in Southwest Montana. 
      Explored the intersection of glaciology and machine learning through interactive lectures and hands-on projects. 
      Topics included deep learning for remote sensing, Gaussian process emulation, and adjoint methods for glacier modeling.

      Participated in the 2024 <a href="https://2024.hackweek.io/" target="_blank">NASA Hackweek</a> as a research collaborator in the GeoSMART track. 
      Contributed to the “Crunchy Snow” project, developing machine learning models for snow depth retrieval using Sentinel‑1 SAR data. 
      Focused on statistical error analysis and spatial autocorrelation via variograms to improve model accuracy and reliability.
