About Me
------
I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://ams.mines.edu/) at the Colorado School of Mines, where I use geospatial analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling to tackle environmental and infrastructure challenges. My research focuses on risk analysis of oil and gas spills, snow and sea ice remote sensing, and climate adaptation strategies in cold regions.

I've collaborated with organizations like [NASA](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/capacity-building/develop), [NREL](https://www.nrel.gov/), and [ACEP](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/) on projects ranging from Arctic snow variability to renewable energy adoption. Fieldwork plays a central role in my work—I've collected glacier data with the Juneau Icefield Research Program, analyzed snowpack in the French Alps through the WSL-SLF Snow School, and participated in remote expeditions across Alaska’s tundra, rivers, and mountain terrain.

Long-term, I’m passionate about working at the intersection of data science, environmental policy, and community engagement to help design evidence-based strategies for adapting to climate change. I hope to contribute to international efforts that empower vulnerable communities to build resilience in the face of a changing planet.

Outside of research, I love tennis, swimming, and alpine adventures—and I’m always up for a good board game or book!
