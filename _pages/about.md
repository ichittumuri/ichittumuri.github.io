About Me
------
I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://ams.mines.edu/) at the Colorado School of Mines, where I use geospatial analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling to tackle environmental and infrastructure challenges. My research focuses on risk analysis of oil and gas spills, snow and sea ice remote sensing, and climate adaptation strategies in cold regions. I aim to develop data-driven approaches to identify climate vulnerabilities, inform adaptation strategies, and support community resilience.

I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with organizations like NASA, NREL, and the Alaska Center for Energy and Power on projects ranging from Arctic snow variability to renewable energy adoption. Fieldwork plays a central role in my work—I've collected glacier data with the Juneau Icefield Research Program, analyzed snowpack in the French Alps through the WSL-SLF Snow School, and participated in remote expeditions across Alaska’s tundra, rivers, and mountain terrain.

From subway tunnels in New York City to icefields in Alaska and mountain towns in Colorado, I’ve found meaning in working across scales and settings. Outside of research, I love tennis, swimming, and alpine adventures—and I’m always up for a good board game or book!
